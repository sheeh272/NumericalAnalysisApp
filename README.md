# NumericalAnalysisApp
This app provides functionality for solving nonlinear equations, optimization and interpolation. For solving nonlinear equations bisection method is used to get an approximation close enough to solution, then the code switches to newtons method for faster convergence. The utility for optimization uses golden section search and is capable of finding both the minimum and the maximum of a function. For interpolation the user is asked to enter 5 sets of points. The interpolation polynomial is calculated by finding the Lagrange multipliers of each point. For the user interface a homescreen is provided with buttons. The buttons segue the user to which ever utility they select. The nonlinear equation solver and the optimization solver share the same user interface. It is similar to a calculator where buttons are selected to enter input and a text field is designed to return the result. The user interface for interpolation uses text fields to capture data about the sets of points and a UIImageView for the graphing
